                  | ShopLyft was a large 3-month project for the Software Engineering Studio 1A subject. The objective of the project was to design and build a working web application for a theoretical business in which allowed them to sell electronic devices.

                  | As the lead developer, I guided the other team members and provided both technical and design solutions. The class focused on both the technical engineering aspect of the project as well as project management through the utilisation of code sprints, retrospectives, planning, storyboarding, etc.
                  | The project was an overall success as we were able to produce a working and satisfying end result that exceeded the expectations of the subject. This success awarded me a High Distinction in the subject for that semester.
