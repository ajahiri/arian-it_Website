                  | Annulus Share is a personal project to build a social platform as my HSC major project for the IT Multimedia course. Developed using the MeteorJS full-stack framework that features live DOM updates straight from the database. 
                  | The platform enables photography beginners, enthusiasts, and professionals to explore photography, learn from others, and share their work. Every photo contains metadata that is shared among users and is automatically extracted from each uploaded image. This platform give users the freedom to share their work as well as their methods and techniques.

                  | Student Voice is an application designed and developed by
                  a(href="https://halfbeardstudios.com/") "Halfbeard Studios"
                  | . The application was designed to give students the freedom to communicate with their superiors without face-to-face contact. This concept eliminates the fear of reporting issues to superiors and allows students to speak their mind. This was the first application our team had built so we were unfamiliar with the application environment and unaware of the design challenges for mobile.
